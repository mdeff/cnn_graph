    "This notebook shows how to apply our graph ConvNet ([paper] & [code]), or any other, to your structured or unstructured data. For this example, we assume that we have $n$ samples $x_i \\in \\R^{d_x}$ arranged in a data matrix $$X = [x_1, ..., x_n]^T \\in \\R^{n \\times d_x}.$$ Each sample $x_i$ is associated with a vector $y_i \\in \\R^{d_y}$ for a regression task or a label $y_i \\in \\{0,\\ldots,C\\}$ for a classification task.\n",

    "From there, we'll structure our data with a graph $\\G = (\\V, \\E, A)$ where $\\V$ is the set of $d_x = |\\V|$ vertices, $\\E$ is the set of edges and $A \\in \\R^{d_x \\times d_x}$ is the adjacency matrix. That matrix represents the weight of each edge, i.e. $A_{i,j}$ is the weight of the edge connecting $v_i \\in \\V$ to $v_j \\in \\V$. The weights of that feature graph thus represent pairwise relationships between features $i$ and $j$. We call that regime **signal classification / regression**, as the samples $x_i$ to be classified or regressed are graph signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other modelling possibilities include:\n",
    "1. Using a data graph, i.e. an adjacency matrix $A \\in \\R^{n \\times n}$ which represents pairwise relationships between samples $x_i \\in \\R^{d_x}$. The problem is here to predict a graph signal $y \\in \\R^{n \\times d_y}$ given a graph characterized by $A$ and some graph signals $X \\in \\R^{n \\times d_x}$. We call that regime **node classification / regression**, as we classify or regress nodes instead of signals.\n",
    "2. Another problem of interest is whole graph classification, with or without signals on top. We'll call that third regime **graph classification / regression**. The problem here is to classify or regress a whole graph $A_i \\in \\R^{n \\times n}$ (with or without an associated data matrix $X_i \\in \\R^{n \\times d_x}$) into $y_i \\in \\R^{d_y}$. In case we have no signal, we can use a constant vector $X_i = 1_n$ of size $n$."

    "2. **Unstructured data**. We could use a fully connected network, but the learning and computational complexities are gonna be large. An alternative is to construct a sparse similarity graph between features (or between samples) and use a graph ConvNet, effectively structuring the data and drastically reducing the number of parameters through weight sharing. As for classical ConvNets, the number of parameters are independent of the input size.\n",

    "To be able to pool graph signals, we need first to coarsen the graph, i.e. to find which vertices to group together. At the end we'll have multiple graphs, like a pyramid, each at one level of resolution.

That data, of reduced spatial dimensionality, can then be fed to a fully connected layer.\n",
